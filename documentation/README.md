# Front-End Configuration
The following is a walkthrough on how to set up the front-end configuration of the Cyber Chatbot. The front-end configuration has to be set in the following places: <br> 
  1) Slack 
  2) IAM (AWS)  
  3) S3 (AWS) 

 The walkthrough will show how to create an App in Slack, where the steps will guide in setting up the configurations necessary for a chatbot. In order to make the unique calls from the user to Virus Total and Flask, Slack slash commands ```/flask``` and ```/vt``` is being utilized. The Front-end configuration of the Slack will guide in making said Slack slash commands as well as setting up a custom bot which is the Cyber Chatbot with permissions on file upload in Slack from the user.<br> 

 The IAM service of AWS will help us in creating a user and configuring it's access policy for the following AWS services:
  1) **Lambda**: 
  The IAM policy on Lambda will allow us to connect and create our slash command files (Lambda functions utilizing the Access key and secret access key which we will generate) from EC2 through ClaudiaJS.
  2) **S3**:
  The IAM policy on S3 will give permissions for the file upload module to access S3 bucket and store files. It will also allow our slash commands retrieving those files.


 The configuration on the S3 service is also needed in the allowing the Slack slash command in accessing the stored files in the S3 bucket.
