 5. Asking how many Anti-viruses think about a particular file<br>
  **USER**: /vt How many Anti-virus think this file is not safe?<br>

Additionally the user can ask about specific filenames they uploaded previously. If the user does not want to mention the filenames they can query the Cyber Chatbot about the last file uploaded by that user.

While asking the question in a particular channel a user can tag other users and they would be notified about the response. We have enabled tagging of users and the notification for users happens as a functionality of Slack.
